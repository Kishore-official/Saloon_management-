## How Your Project Uses MongoDB Cloud

### Backend Configuration (`app.py`):
```python
MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://edwin:Edwin006@saloon.8fxk7vz.mongodb.net/?appName=Saloon'
MONGODB_DB = 'Saloon'

# Connects to cloud database
connect(host=MONGODB_URI, db=MONGODB_DB)
```

### All Data Operations Use Cloud:

1. **Dashboard Queries:**
   - Staff performance → Reads from cloud Bills, Appointments
   - Top performer → Reads from cloud Feedback, Bills
   - Revenue stats → Reads from cloud Bills

2. **Inventory Module:**
   - Suppliers list → Reads from cloud Suppliers collection
   - Add/Edit/Delete → Writes to cloud Suppliers collection

3. **Customer Lifecycle:**
   - Segments → Reads from cloud Customers collection
   - Lifecycle data → Reads from cloud Bills for visit history

4. **Reports & Analytics:**
   - All reports → Query cloud collections
   - Export data → Exports from cloud
